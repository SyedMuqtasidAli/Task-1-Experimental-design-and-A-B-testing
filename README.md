## 📋 Introduction
A/B testing is a powerful technique for comparing two versions of a web page or app to determine which one performs better. This project guides you through designing and analyzing A/B tests, including hypothesis formulation, test design, data collection, and analysis.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Formulate hypotheses for a hypothetical scenario.
- Design an A/B test to compare two variations.
- Collect and analyze data to draw conclusions.
- Make data-driven recommendations based on the test results.

## 🛠️ Installation
To get started with the A/B Test Design and Analysis project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/syed-muqtasid-ali/ab-test-design-analysis.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd ab-test-design-analysis
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed** (see Installation section).

2. **Place the `Data.txt` file in the project directory**.

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook "Week2 Day4 Task1.ipynb"
    ```

4. **Follow the instructions within the notebook to design the A/B test, collect data, and perform analysis**.

## 📈 A/B Test Design
The notebook `Week2 Day4 Task1.ipynb` covers the following steps for designing and analyzing A/B tests:
